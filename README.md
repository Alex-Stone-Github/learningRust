# learningRust
I want to learn how to do rust stuff.

## Rust is cool
Rust is cool but frustrating. I want to learn rust alongside go because they both
seem like really cool languages, but rust is frustrating. I like the memory safety,
cool features, and quickness, but I know it will take some time to get used to the
langauage.
